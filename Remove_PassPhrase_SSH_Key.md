# Remove passphrase from your existing SSH key
Run this command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
(replace id_rsa with your actual key filename if it's different, like id_ed25519.)

It will ask you:

```sql
Enter old passphrase:
```
ðŸ‘‰ Type your current passphrase.

Then it will ask:

```php
Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```
ðŸ‘‰ Just press Enter (don't type anything).

Confirm by pressing Enter again when asked.

Thatâ€™s it!
Now your SSH private key has no passphrase and Git will use it without asking anything.

âš¡ Important note: Without a passphrase, your SSH key is less secure.
Anyone who gets access to your private key file can connect as you â€” so keep it safe (permissions 600 on the file).

You can make sure permissions are correct:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
